The grading rubric for the final can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/paulboal/hds5210-2023/blob/main/final/final-instructions.pdf

**Functional Requirements**
* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice
* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.

**(-1) Generic variable names like `df1` or `df2` are not acceptable.  They make it hard for the reader to understand what is going on and what this variable refers to.**

**(-1) You concatenated these df1 and df2 side by side, but the ids don't match up between the two sets.  Do they actually match up that way?**

**(-3) You concated data once, but were required to merge/join or concatenate data at least twice**

**Nice work on developing and answering questions for your analysis.  You did a great job on this project with just a few missed requirements.**
