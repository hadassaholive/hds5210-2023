# Midterm Feedback
The midterm feedback will be very similar to what you receive on a weekly basis for the homework, but more specific for each problem in this case.

## Final Score: 39/50


### Step 1: Priest Score Calculation
* **5pts** - Your code computed the correct probability and returned it
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **(-3pts)** - No doctests


### Step 2: Find a Hospital
* **5pts** - Your code correctly fetched the correct hospital given the inputs using requests
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **(-3pts)** - No doctests

### Step 3: Get the Hospital Address
* **5pts** - Your code correctly fetched the JSON file, parsed it, and looked up the hospital
  * **(-2 pts) This code does not load the remote file. It also returns `none` instead of `None` within the loop -- this code shouldn't work.**
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **(-3pts)** - No doctests

### Step 4: Process List of Patients
* **10pts** - Your code correctly fetched the psv file, looped through it, and ran your other functions
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for

### Step 5: Compare Results
* **(-5pts)** - No solution submitted

### Extra Credit
* Up to 15 pts based on correctness and quality of the extra credit step
* **(+5 pts) This made an attempt to do some processing, but did not correctly create a summary dictionary with all possible hospital values from the patient data.  The Hospital/Home were hardcoded**

### Coding Best Practices:
**3 pts** - Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
